# Pulsatile Signal Cleansing



## ABP Signal Artifact Simulator


### Overview

This repository contains the beta version of the ABP Signal Artifact Simulator. The simulator is designed to generate artifacts in ABP (Arterial Blood Pressure) signals for research and testing purposes.



### Current Research

Research based on the official version of this simulator is currently ongoing. 



### Usage

Please note that this beta version is primarily for developmental use and may contain bugs or incomplete features. Users are advised to proceed with caution and are encouraged to contact the authors for more information or to discuss potential collaborations.
The file containing the necessary functions for simulating ABP signal artifacts, named [artifact_generator.py](lib/artifact_generator.py), is located in the [lib](lib) folder of the repository. This Python script includes all the core functionalities required for generating artifacts in Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) signals for research and testing purposes.
